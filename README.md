# Image_Recognition_ML
This project guides through building an image recognition model in Python using deep learning. Over five days, I  learn fundamental concepts and practical skills in image classification, culminating in a deployable, portfolio-ready toolkit showcasing my expertise in computer vision.

**About This Project**
Image Recognition 5 Days Bootcamp is a hands-on, project-based journey into modern computer vision. Built and tested entirely in Google Colab, this bootcamp covers:

Day 1:
Dataset download, MNIST & CIFAR-10 exploration, preprocessing, and visualization
Day 2:
Building and training a CNN from scratch (TensorFlow/Keras)
Day 3:
Data augmentation, batch normalization, and advanced model training
Day 4:
Transfer learning with MobileNetV2 on Cats vs. Dogs dataset (Kaggle)
Day 5:
Model evaluation, ROC/AUC, deployment tips

**Why This Project?**
End-to-End Workflow: From data prep to model evaluation, this repo demonstrates a real-world ML pipeline.
Industry-Ready Practices: Includes transfer learning, data augmentation, and efficient model evaluation.
Recruiter Value: Shows experience with TensorFlow, Keras, Colab, Kaggle, GitHub, and modern ML best practices.
Portfolio Showcase: Each notebook cell is annotated for clarity and reproducibility.
